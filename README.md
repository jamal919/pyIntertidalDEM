# pyIntertidalDEM

pyIntertidalDEM is a set of libraries and procedures written in python to extract shorelines from spectral images using
a ophisticated shoreline extraction algorithm. These modules are developed in Python v3 environment.

## Setup

Currently the toolbox is only available as a git repository, and not published in any of the common python repository -
like pip or conda. Below is how you can install the package. It is highly recommended to use conda/miniconda
environment.

* Step 0: Download the source-code in a directory. For that use either the download button or `git clone` command.
* Step 1: Create a conda environment from environment.yml file `conda env create -n pyintdem -f environment.yml`.
  It will create a new environment in your computer and install the pyintdem library.
* Step 3: Activate conda environment `conda activate pyintdem`. Remember to use this environment each time you
  work with the toolbox.

## Processing

As explained in the associated [publication](#publications), the toolbox was developed to analyze Sentinel-2 imageries.
However,
it is generic enough (e.g., Band class) to use with other image sets.

Example scripts are provided showing various steps of the processing.

* `examples/step_1_extract.py`: This is a small script for extracting .zip archives of Sentinel-2 Images and nicely
  organize them tile-by-tile.
* `examples/step_2_create_mask.py`: This example illustrates how to create a mask from a set of images in a tile. This
  gross water mask is then used in the next step for final analysis. To be noted that, this mask generation procedure
  needs to be done only once, or can be fully skipped if you already have a gross mask of the land-water body.
* `examples/step_3_analysis.py`: This scripts implements the Sentinel-2 processing methodology shown in Khan et al.
  2019. Various classes (e.g., Band, RGB) from the toolbox is used for the analysis, and the script can be modified as
  required by the end-user to test or to implement their own method.

## Documentation

Currently the program is documented at source level and strongly believed that the use of the program falls on the left
side of the xkcd documentation spectram!
